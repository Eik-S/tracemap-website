            <p>The interactive interface allows you to visualize how tweets flow. It is designed to directly reveal a tweet’s outreach and to see which users contributed to its distribution.<br><br>
            TraceMap exposes implicit and hidden diffusion mechanisms. Interactive graphs - "tracemaps" - will allow you to track the spreading of tweets. For example, you will be able to spot the users who are more influential and more densely connected.</p>

            After generating a tweet’s tracemap, you can obtain informative statistics and analyze the most influential profiles who contribute to the diffusion of a tweet. With more information at hand, you will be able to form a more solid opinion about the trustworthiness of the news you are reading.</p>

                In order to develop a platform on which people can trust each other, we intend to provide a cross-checking mechanism, that is, a system of fact-checking badges for users that correctly classify content (e.g. satire, sarcasm, fake, misleading context, etc). This way, we want to make sure that the tags shown are all valid and that our platform is protected against bots and trolls.</p>
